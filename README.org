* Docker build of Minecraft Server
  This repository builds a Docker container hosting a Minecraft
  server.  I chose to build a Minecraft container because I saw
  someone else on the Internet do the same for a Docker tutorial, so I
  decided to join in.

** Run It
   Assuming you have Docker installed, you may try out this image
   immediately:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker run -it --rm stoo/minecraft
   #+END_SRC

** Build It
   Run the following to create the images:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     make
   #+END_SRC

   If you want the new image to be tagged as "latest", run make as
   follows:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     make latest
   #+END_SRC

** Host Interface
   The container defines a volume at /minecraft and exposes
   port 25565.

** Dependencies
   - GNU Make
   - Docker
